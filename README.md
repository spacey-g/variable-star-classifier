# ✨ Variable Star Classifier (Machine Learning)

A machine learning classifier for identifying **different classes of variable stars** using features extracted from light curves.

This project demonstrates:
- Time-series feature engineering  
- Astroinformatics  
- ML classification  
- Data visualization  
- Clean scientific project structure

## ⭐ Goal

To build a robust ML model that classifies stars into categories such as:

- RR Lyrae  
- Cepheids  
- Delta Scuti  
- Eclipsing Binaries  
- Rotational Variables  

Using:
- Summary statistics  
- Period-finding algorithms  
- Fourier features  
- Light curve shape descriptors

TESS/Kepler FITS or simulated data.

### 2️⃣ Extract Features  
Planned features include:
- Period (Lomb-Scargle)  
- Amplitude  
- Standard deviation  
- Flux percentiles  
- Skewness  
- Peak-to-peak variation  
- Fourier harmonics  

### 3️⃣ Train Classification Models
Models considered:
